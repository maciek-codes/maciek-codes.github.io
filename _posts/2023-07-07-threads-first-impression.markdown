title:  My first impression of Meta's Threads

I jumped on the [Threads](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/) bandwagon. Whatever you think of Meta and Zuckerberg, it's a big player from day 0. Unlike [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), which was an attempt to dethrone Facebook 12 years ago, or B.sky that still pretends that it's the 2004 GMail, it actually got immediate traction among users.

What I find impressive about Threads:
- It's fast
- Signup was effortless with my existing Instagram account
- There are no ads (yet)
- People are still excited, positive and civil

What I find annoying about threads:
- No browser experience
- No "only people I follow" view

I am looking forward to observing how it develops. If the excitement dies down or if people move to it and neglect Twitter.
Twitter made a series of some questionable moves, like rate limiting, removing API access or requiring to log-in to view Tweets. Most users probably don't care, but Threads starts with a clean slate and doesn't appear hostile towards its users.

Hope it is there to stay and that it encourages Twitter to improve.
